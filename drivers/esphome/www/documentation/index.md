Integrate [ESPHome-based devices](https://devices.esphome.io) into Control4.
ESPHome is an open-source system that transforms common microcontrollers, like
ESP8266 and ESP32, into smart home devices through simple YAML configuration.
ESPHome devices can be set up, monitored, and controlled using a web browser,
Home Assistant, or other compatible platforms. This driver enables seamless
monitoring and control of ESPHome devices directly from your Control4 system.

> If you already have the
> [DriverCentral Cloud driver](https://drivercentral.io/platforms/control4-drivers/utility/drivercentral-cloud-driver/)
> installed in your project you can continue to
> [Driver Installation](#driver-installation).

This driver relies on the DriverCentral Cloud driver to manage licensing and
automatic updates. If you are new to using DriverCentral you can refer to their
[Cloud Driver](https://help.drivercentral.io/407519-Cloud-Driver) documentation
for setting it up.

<!-- #endif -->

## Driver Installation

Driver installation and setup are similar to most other ip-based drivers. Below
is an outline of the basic steps for your convenience.

<!-- #ifdef DRIVERCENTRAL -->

1. Download the latest `control4-esphome.zip` from
   [DriverCentral](https://drivercentral.io/platforms/control4-drivers/utility/esphome).
2. Extract and
   [install](https://www.control4.com/help/c4/software/cpro/dealer-composer-help/content/composerpro_userguide/adding_drivers_manually.htm)
   all `.c4z` files.
3. Use the "Search" tab to find the "ESPHome" driver and add it to your project.

   > ⚠️ A **_single_** driver instance is required per ESPHome device.

   ![Search Drivers](images/search-drivers.png)

4. Select the newly added driver in the "System Design" tab. You will notice
   that the `Cloud Status` reflects the license state. If you have purchased a
   license it will show `License Activated`, otherwise `Trial Running` and
   remaining trial duration.
5. You can refresh license status by selecting the "DriverCentral Cloud" driver
   in the "System Design" tab and perform the "Check Drivers" action.
   <br><img alt="Check Drivers" src="./images/check-drivers.png" width="300"/>
6. Configure the [Device Settings](#device-settings) with the connection
   information.
7. After a few moments the [`Driver Status`](#driver-status-read-only) will
   display `Connected`. If the driver fails to connect, set the
   [`Log Mode`](#log-mode--off--print--log--print-and-log-) property to `Print`
   and re-set the [`IP Adress`](#ip-address) field to reconnect. Then check the
   lua output window for more information.
8. Once connected, the driver will automatically create variables and connection
   bindings for each supported entity type.
9. To control lights, fans, and/or locks, use the "Search" tab to find the
   "ESPHome Light", "ESPHome Fan", and/or "ESPHome Lock" driver. For fans,
   choose the speed variant that matches your fan (e.g., "ESPHome Fan (3
   Speed)"). Add one driver instance for each exposed entity in your project. In
   the "Connections" tab, select the "ESPHome" driver and bind the entities to
   the newly added drivers.

- **None**: No authentication required.
- **Password**: Use a password for authentication (see below).
- **Encryption Key**: Use an encryption key for secure communication (see
  below).

> **Tip:** For ESPHome devices used primarily as Bluetooth proxies, consider
> configuring the firmware without API encryption. In busy BLE environments, the
> volume of proxy traffic combined with the controller's limited cryptographic
> performance can cause significant CPU load. BLE traffic is inherently
> over-the-air, and sensitive protocols (such as Yale/August lock commands) use
> their own end-to-end encryption between the driver and the device, making it
> safe to relay through an unencrypted proxy. To disable encryption, omit the
> `encryption` block from the ESPHome `api:` configuration and set
> Authentication Mode to `None`.

##### Password

Shown only if
[Authentication Mode](#authentication-mode--none--password--encryption-key-) is
set to `Password`. Sets the device password. This must match the password
configured on the ESPHome device.

##### Encryption Key

Shown only if
[Authentication Mode](#authentication-mode--none--password--encryption-key-) is
set to `Encryption Key`. Sets the device encryption key for secure
communication. This must match the encryption key configured on the ESPHome
device.

##### Use OpenSSL [ **_Yes_** | No ]

Use OpenSSL for encryption. This should typically be left at the default value
of `Yes` for better performance and compatibility.

#### Bluetooth Proxy Settings

> The Bluetooth Proxy feature requires an ESP32 device with the
> `bluetooth_proxy` component configured in ESPHome. See the
> [ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy documentation](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy.html)
> for firmware configuration.

##### Bluetooth Proxy Status (read-only)

Shows the current state of the Bluetooth proxy. The format is a pipe-separated
list of status components:

**Standalone Mode:** `Standalone Mode | Scanning (Passive) | 1/4 Active`

**Coordinator Mode:**
`Coordinator Mode | Scanning (Passive) | 0/3 Active | MAC Filter: 5`

Components explained:

- **Mode** - "Standalone Mode" or "Coordinator Mode" depending on whether the
  driver is connected to a Bluetooth Coordinator
- **Scanner State** - Current state (Idle, Starting, Running, Stopping, Stopped,
  Failed) and mode (Passive or Active)
- **Connection Slots** - Shows "used/total Active" slots (e.g., "1/4 Active"
  means 1 slot in use out of 4 available). If you select more active devices
  than available slots, "(Oversubscribed)" is appended (see
  [Oversubscription](#oversubscription))
- **MAC Filter** - (Coordinator mode only) Shows how many device MACs are being
  filtered for, or "none" if forwarding all advertisements

##### Bluetooth Proxy Capabilities (read-only)

Displays a comma-separated list of capabilities supported by this ESPHome
Bluetooth proxy:

- **Scan** - Can receive BLE advertisements (passive scanning)
- **Connect** - Can establish GATT connections to devices (active connections)
- **Cache** - Caches GATT service data remotely
- **Pair** - Can pair with devices requiring authentication
- **Raw** - Can receive raw advertisement data

##### Select Bluetooth Devices

> Only visible in **Standalone Mode** (hidden when connected to a Bluetooth
> Coordinator, as device selection is done there instead).

- When complete, the dropdown repopulates with discovered devices

**Device list shows:**

- MAC Address
- Device Name (if available)
- Device Type (BTHome, SwitchBot, Govee, etc.)
- Connection Type (Active/Passive)

After selecting a device, a connection binding is automatically created for the
appropriate sub-driver.

> **Tip:** Some BLE devices (buttons, sensors with long advertisement intervals)
> may be in sleep mode. Wake them by pressing buttons, triggering motion
> sensors, or opening/closing contact sensors during the scan to ensure they
> appear in the device list.

##### Bluetooth Scan Duration [ 5 - 60, default: **_30_** ]

> Only visible in **Standalone Mode**.

Sets how long (in seconds) to scan for BLE devices when refreshing the device
list. Longer scans may discover more devices with long advertisement intervals.

##### Bluetooth Proxy Room

> Only visible in **Coordinator Mode** (when connected to a Bluetooth
> Coordinator).

Sets the room where this Bluetooth proxy is physically located. This is used for
presence tracking to determine which room a device is in based on signal
strength.

##### Minimum Room RSSI Override (dBm) [ -100 - -40, default: **_-100_** ]

> Only visible in **Coordinator Mode** (when connected to a Bluetooth
> Coordinator).

Overrides the coordinator's global "Minimum Room RSSI" setting for this proxy's
room. Use this when a room has different size or characteristics than others.

- **-100 (default)** - Use the coordinator's global setting
- **-85** - More permissive; allow detection from further away (large rooms)
- **-60** - More restrictive; require closer proximity (small rooms)

**Examples:**

- Large living room: Set to `-85` to allow detection from further away
- Small bathroom: Set to `-60` to require closer proximity
- Leave at `-100` to use the coordinator's global setting

> **Note:** Only affects room assignment for this proxy. The value is sent to
> the Bluetooth Coordinator when this proxy connects or when the setting
> changes.

# <span style="display:none">Configuration Guides</span>

# <span style="color:#17BCF2">ratgdo Configuration Guide</span>

This guide provides instructions for configuring the ESPHome driver to work with
ratgdo devices for garage door control via relays in Control4 Composer Pro.

## Add Relay Controller Driver

Add the desired relay controller driver to your Control4 project in Composer
Pro.

<img alt="Relay Controller Drivers" src="./images/relay-controller-drivers.png" width="250"/>

## Relay Controller Properties

The ratgdo device exposes a "Cover" entity in ESPHome, which maps to the relay
controller functionality in Control4.

### Number of Relays

The ratgdo device uses a multi-relay configuration to control the garage door.
In Composer Pro, you should configure the relay settings as follows:

- Set to **2 Relays** (Open/Close) or **3 Relays** (Open/Close/Stop)
  - The ratgdo device uses separate commands for opening and closing the garage
    door
  - If your ratgdo firmware supports the "stop" command, configure for 3 relays
    to enable the stop functionality. If you are not sure, you can look at the
    ratgdo connections in Composer Pro to see if the "Stop Door" relay is
    available.

### Relay Configuration

- Set to **Pulse**
  - ratgdo uses momentary pulses to trigger the garage door opener, similar to a
    wall button press

### Pulse Time

- Set all relay pulse times to **500** (default)
  - This is the duration the relay will be activated

### Invert Relay

- Set all invert relay properties to **No** (default)

### Contact Debounce

- Set all contact debounce times to **250** (default)
  - This helps prevent false flapping of the garage door state sensors

### Invert Contact

- Set all invert contact properties to **No** (default)

### Example Properties

For reference, here is an example of the relay controller properties in Composer
Pro:

<img alt="Relay Controller Properties" src="./images/relay-controller-properties.png" width="550"/>

## Relay Controller Connections

### Relays

- **Open**: Connect to the ratgdo's "Open Door" relay
- **Close**: Connect to the ratgdo's "Close Door" relay
- **Stop**: Connect to the ratgdo's "Stop Door" relay, if available

### Contact Sensors

- **Closed Contact**: Connect to the ratgdo's "Door Closed" contact
- **Opened Contact**: Connect to the ratgdo's "Door Open" contact

### Example Connections

For reference, here is an example of how the connections should look in Composer
Pro:

<img alt="Relay Controller Connections" src="./images/relay-controller-connections.png" width="550"/>

## Programming

You can create programming in Control4 to:

- Open/close the garage door based on events
- Monitor the garage door state
- Set up notifications for garage door status changes
- Create custom buttons on touchscreens and remotes

### Example: Creating a "Still Open" Alert

Using the "Still Open Time" property from the relay controller driver:

1. Set the "Still Open Time" to your desired duration (e.g., 10 minutes)
2. Create a programming rule that triggers when the "Still Open" event fires
3. Add actions to send notifications or perform other tasks

## Additional Entities

Depending on your ratgdo device, firmware, and its capabilities, there may be
additional entities exposed by the ESPHome driver. These can come as additional
connections or driver variables.

# <span style="color:#17BCF2">Bluetooth Proxy Configuration Guide</span>

This guide explains how to use the ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy feature to integrate
BLE devices into Control4.

## Prerequisites

- ESP32 device with ESPHome firmware and `bluetooth_proxy` component enabled
- BLE devices within range of the ESP32

**Recommended Hardware:**

The following POE-powered Bluetooth proxies are excellent choices with 4 active
connection slots:

- [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32C6-p-5884.html)
  with POE expansion board
- [Olimex ESP32-POE](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32/ESP32-POE/open-source-hardware)
  or
  [ESP32-POE-ISO](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32/ESP32-POE-ISO/open-source-hardware)

**Firmware Installation:**

- **Quick Start:** Use [web.esphome.io](https://web.esphome.io) for one-click
  firmware installation directly in your browser - no YAML configuration needed.
- **Advanced:** For more control over settings, create a custom YAML
  configuration. See the
  [ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy documentation](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy.html)
  for configuration options.

## Understanding Connection Types

BLE devices use one of two connection modes:

### Passive Mode (No Slot Required)

Passive devices broadcast their data in advertisements. The proxy listens
without establishing a connection. These devices include:

- **Shelly BLU devices** - Button, Door/Window, Motion, H&T sensors (native
  BTHome support)
- **BTHome sensors** - Temperature, humidity, motion, door sensors
- **Govee sensors** - Temperature/humidity monitors, meat thermometers
- **SwitchBot sensors** - Meters, motion sensors, contact sensors, water leak

**Advantage:** Unlimited passive devices can be monitored simultaneously.

### Active Mode (Uses Connection Slot)

Active devices require a GATT connection to send commands. The ESP32 has limited
connection slots (typically 3-4). These devices include:

- **SwitchBot Bot** - Requires connection to send press/on/off commands
- **SwitchBot Switch** - Plug Mini, Relay switches (encrypted commands)
- **Yale/August Locks** - Requires connection for encrypted lock/unlock commands

### Oversubscription

You can select more active devices than available connection slots. This is
called **oversubscription** and works well when devices only need brief
connections to exchange data (e.g., sending a command to a SwitchBot Bot). The
device connects, sends the command, and immediately frees the slot.

Oversubscription becomes problematic when multiple devices need simultaneous
connections. If all slots are in use, commands to additional devices will queue
and retry until a slot becomes available.

> **Tip:** If you see "Allocation failed" errors in the logs, you have too many
> concurrent active connections. Consider reducing the number of active devices
> or adding another proxy.

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Add the ESPHome driver** and configure it to connect to your ESP32 device.

2. **Verify Bluetooth Proxy Status** shows "Ready" with available slots.

3. **Scan for devices:**
   - Set "Bluetooth Scan Duration" (30 seconds recommended)
   - Select "Refresh List" from the "Select Bluetooth Devices" dropdown
   - Wait for the scan to complete

4. **Select a discovered device** from the dropdown. A connection will be
   automatically created.

5. **Add the appropriate sub-driver:**
   - Search for the driver matching your device type (e.g., "ESPHome BTHome")
   - Add it to your project

6. **Bind the sub-driver** to the connection created in step 4.

7. **Configure the sub-driver** properties as needed.

## Supported Device Types

| Device Protocol | Sub-Driver        | Connection     |
| --------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| BTHome          | ESPHome BTHome    | Passive        |
| Govee           | ESPHome Govee     | Passive        |
| SwitchBot       | ESPHome SwitchBot | Active/Passive |
| Yale/August     | ESPHome Yale      | Active         |

## Performance Considerations

### Device Limits

The ESP32 Bluetooth proxy has practical limits on device capacity:

| Connection Type    | Recommended Limit | Notes                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Passive devices    | 20-30             | Sensors broadcasting advertisements |
| Active connections | 3-5               | Devices requiring GATT connections  |

Exceeding these limits may cause:

- Missed advertisements from passive devices
- "Allocation failed" errors for active connections
- Delayed or failed commands to active devices

> **Warning:** If you see "Too many BLE events to process" in the logs, the
> proxy is overwhelmed. Reduce the number of tracked devices or add another
> proxy.

### Busy BLE Environments

In environments with many BLE devices (smart home hubs, fitness equipment,
wireless speakers, neighbors' devices), performance may degrade:

- **2.4 GHz congestion** - BLE and WiFi share spectrum; heavy WiFi traffic
  affects BLE reception
- **Advertisement flooding** - Many devices broadcasting simultaneously can
  overwhelm the scanner
- **Interference sources** - Microwaves, USB 3.0 devices, and poorly shielded
  electronics cause interference

**Mitigation strategies:**

1. Use Ethernet-connected ESP32 boards (Olimex ESP32-POE) to avoid WiFi/BLE
   contention
2. Position proxies away from WiFi routers (at least 2-3 meters)
3. Use the Bluetooth Coordinator to distribute load across multiple proxies
4. Reduce scan duration if not actively discovering new devices

### Proxy Placement Tips

For optimal BLE reception:

- **Height matters** - Place at chest height or higher, not on the floor
- **Avoid metal** - Keep away from refrigerators, filing cabinets, and metal
  shelving (metal causes reflections and unstable signals)
- **Avoid enclosed spaces** - Don't place inside cabinets or behind furniture
- **Distance from electronics** - Keep 2-3 meters from routers, switches, and
  other network equipment

**Coverage expectations:**

| Environment          | Typical Range           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Open indoor space    | 10-15 meters (30-50 ft) |
| Through 1-2 walls    | 5-10 meters (15-30 ft)  |
| Concrete/brick walls | 3-5 meters (10-15 ft)   |

## Bluetooth Coordinator Setup

For advanced setups with **multiple ESPHome Bluetooth proxies**, use the
**ESPHome Bluetooth Coordinator** driver to aggregate them. The coordinator
provides:

- **RSSI-based routing** - Commands are routed to the proxy with the best signal
  strength for each BLE device
- **Automatic failover** - If a connection fails, the coordinator retries
  through alternate proxies
- **Room-level presence tracking** - Track which room a BLE device (like a
  phone) is in based on signal strength from each proxy

> **Note:** Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch) and Android devices with
> MAC randomization enabled cannot be tracked for presence. Use dedicated BLE
> beacons or devices with static MAC addresses instead.

### When to Use the Coordinator

| Setup                    | Recommendation              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Single ESP32 proxy       | Use ESPHome driver directly |
| Multiple proxies         | Use Bluetooth Coordinator   |
| Want presence tracking   | Use Bluetooth Coordinator   |
| Want failover/redundancy | Use Bluetooth Coordinator   |

### Coordinator Setup Steps

1. **Add the Bluetooth Coordinator driver** to your project
2. **Connect your ESPHome drivers** to the coordinator's proxy bindings
   (Connections tab)
3. **Set the "Bluetooth Proxy Room" property** on each ESPHome driver to
   indicate where that proxy is physically located
4. **Select devices** via the coordinator's "Select Bluetooth Devices" property
5. **For presence tracking**, select devices via "Select Presence Devices"

When an ESPHome driver is connected to the coordinator:

- The "Select Bluetooth Devices" property is hidden (selection is done in the
  coordinator)
- The "Bluetooth Proxy Room" property becomes visible for presence tracking
  configuration

See the **ESPHome Bluetooth Coordinator** driver documentation for full details
on presence tracking settings and events.
